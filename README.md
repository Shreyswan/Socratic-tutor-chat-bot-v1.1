# Socratic-tutor-chat-bot-v1.1
## What is it?
The streamlit app that you are using is a chatbot and as the name suggests it uses the Socratic method of teaching.
It supports the Llama3, gemma and mixtral AI models as of now. 
You as a user can choose which AI model you want and converse with it. 
It has two modes of usage:
1. Regualsr chatbot to whom you can ask any question.
2. A Socratic tutor who helps you as user to learn a concept of your choice.

## How to use it?
As said above, there are two ways to use it:
1. Regular Chatbot: As you use the ChatGPT to resolve your doubts, this works in the same fashion, 
                        There is no limit to the size if your prompt. So ask away and get rid of your doubts.
2. Socratic Tutor:  In a mood for actually learning something? Then this is the real purpose of this app.
                        simply click the initiate tutor button and you will start learning about a pre-defined concept
                        that is the significance of actuators and sensors for Raspberry Pi.
                        However, how can i possibly limit it to that?
                        you can learn the topic of ur chioce by simply telling the Chatbot about your needs
                        and at the end of it you can add something like "Pleas use the Socratic tutor method for this"
                        and thw model will do so.
    
## Key Features: 
* The chatting experience is as smooth as any other.
* You as a user will be able to view your chat history of the current session as much as you want.
* You have the ability to change the model on the fly (no need to create another session for another model)

## What's new in v1.1?
Yes this is the 1.1 version of the Socratic Tutor, and although the logic of chatting has remained same,
There are some changes however which have been made.
following is the list:
* Introduction of Usernames: In this version, say hello to usernames. Now you might be familiar with these. 
      choose whichever you want and next time onwards you have to login with that username. 
      This feature allows the code to keep the all the user's history separate from each other. 
      (feel safer now?)
* Encryption: The usernames that you have chosen are encrypted by a super secret key. this prevents anyone from knowing
      your secret username.
* Settings page: See that shiny new page on the sidebar? Yes it is settings. For now, the only features are Deleting your 
      history and Deleting your account. 

At the end of it, I am thankful for you to use my app and I hope this was a great learning experience.
Thank You!!
